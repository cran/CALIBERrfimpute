=====================================
Version 0.1-6
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Errors in mice.impute.rfcat and mice.impute.rfcont
  when there is one missing value and multiple predictors
  (thanks to David Erceg-Hurn for finding this bug)
- Error in mice.impute.rfcat when all observed
  values are identical (thanks to David Erceg-Hurn for
  finding this bug)

=====================================
Version 0.1-5
=====================================

CHANGES:

- Update vignette to investigate RF Doove
  with different numbers of trees. Remove
  rfImpute from vignette, as it is not
  suitable for survival data
- Updated author names in DESCRIPTION.

BUG FIXES:

- Corrections to vignette so that it works
  on multiple platforms
- Ensure that rfcont works with a single column
  predictor - randomForest requires the predictor
  to be a matrix even if one column (thanks to
  Jonathan Bartlett for finding this bug)
