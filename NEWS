  URLs in documentation.

=====================================
Version 1.0-7
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Added the ranger package as a suggested
  package so that the vignette works with the
  latest version of mice. Application
  made to update on CRAN.

=====================================
Version 1.0-6
=====================================

=====================================
Version 1.0-4
=====================================

CHANGES:

- Changed BuildVignettes to TRUE.

=====================================
Version 1.0-3
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Dropped from CRAN because vignettes were
  not building using latest version of mice.
  The method of extracting pooled coefficients
  from multiply imputed datasets has been
  changed. Application made for reinstating
  this updated version on CRAN.

=====================================
Version 1.0-2
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Vignette updated to work with latest
  version of survival package (ensuring
  that it works in the event of a missing
  cumulative hazard estimate).

=====================================
Version 1.0-1
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Vignette updated to work with mice 3
  format of multiple imputation results.

=====================================
Version 1.0-0
=====================================

CHANGES:

- Allow mice.impute.rfcat to work with logical
  variables (consistent with mice.impute.logreg)

=====================================
Version 0.1-6
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Errors in mice.impute.rfcat and mice.impute.rfcont
  when there is one missing value and multiple predictors
  (thanks to David Erceg-Hurn for finding this bug).
- Error in mice.impute.rfcat when all observed
  values are identical (thanks to David Erceg-Hurn for
  finding this bug).

=====================================
Version 0.1-5
=====================================

CHANGES:

- Update vignette to investigate RF Doove
  with different numbers of trees. Remove
  rfImpute from vignette, as it is not
  suitable for survival data.
- Updated author names in DESCRIPTION.

BUG FIXES:

- Corrections to vignette so that it works
  on multiple platforms.
- Ensure that rfcont works with a single column
  predictor - randomForest requires the predictor
  to be a matrix even if one column (thanks to
  Jonathan Bartlett for finding this bug).

=====================================
Version 0.1-4
=====================================

CHANGES:

- A new argument ntree, to correspond to the ntree
  argument in mice.impute.rf.

=====================================

CHANGES:

- Added information and links for the mice.impute.rf
  and mice.impute.cart methods in mice version 2.20.
- Added reference to published paper.

=====================================
Version 0.1-2
=====================================

CHANGES:

- A new option: maxnodes (maximum number of nodes in
  regresion tree).

=====================================
Version 0.1-1
=====================================

BUG FIXES:

- Allow factors with missing categories in rfcat.
- Allow single predictor for imputation models.
