=====================================
Version 0.1-5
third release onto CRAN

CHANGES:

- Update vignette to investigate RF Doove
  with different numbers of trees. Remove
  rfImpute from vignette, as it is not
  suitable for survival data

BUG FIXES:

- Corrections to vignette so that it works
  on multiple platforms
- Ensure that rfcont works with a single column
  predictor - randomForest requires the predictor
  to be a matrix even if one column (thanks to
  Jonathan Bartlett for finding this bug)
